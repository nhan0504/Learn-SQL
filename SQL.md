# SQL
## **Overview**
### **What is SQL**
- SQL (Structured Query Language): A standard language for relational database
- A non-procedural language -> Won't be able to write application with it
- Usage:
  - Read/retrieve data
  - Write data: Add data to a table
  - Update data: Insert new data
### **Relational database vs Transactional database**

<center> Relational             | <center> Transaction
--------------------------------|---------------------
Show relatinship between tables | More like operational database
Optimize for query -> Easier to access data | Good for reading and writting rows quickly

### **Data model building blocks**

<center> Entity | <center> Attribute | <center> Relationship
-------|-----------|-------------
Person, place, event, ... that are unique and distinguishable | Characteristic of an entity | Relation between entities
|||One-to-many (Eg: 1 costumers have many invoices)
|||Many-to-many (Eg: Many students to many classes)
|||One-to-one (Eg: Each store has 1 manager)
